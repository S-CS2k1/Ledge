# Ledge(Work in progress)

A data storing app built on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node js and MongoDB

For routing Express js is used, which is a module built in Node.

An ODM(Object Data Mapper) is used called Monogoose, which helps in mapping the documents coming from the database, i.e MongoDB, into usable JS objects.
